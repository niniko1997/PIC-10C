# PIC-10C: Projects

## Project One:

The first project was to program a card game known as "Siete y Medio". The goal of the card game is to have the user play against the dealer and get cards such as the total card value is closest to 7 1/2 without going over it. 

## Project Two: 

The goal of the second project is to design and implement a Qt Graphical User Interface that computes the grade of a student given a set of homework and exam scores. 

## Project Three:

The purpose of this project is to program and implement a ring queue container, which holds a finite number of values but never goes out of scope. Instead, it repleaces old values with new values when all the memory slots are filled. Additionally, this project also implements the iterator for a ring queue container.
